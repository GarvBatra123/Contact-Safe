# Flask-Web-Application
Multi-user flask application, with DB Integration

This is a web-application that me and my friend had created for a school project, in our curriculum. 

This application is a platform for users to store the contact numbers on their phones onto this application, making it easier for them to obtain these phone numbers should they lose their phones or change from an IoS to an Android device. 

To run this application, download and extract the zip file <"Multi User Flask Application.zip">, then run the "main.py" in the IDE of your choice.
